# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python
This Python program implements a simple, interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. It leverages Python's random module to allow the computer to make a random choice between rock, paper, and scissors. The program compares the player's input to the computer's choice, determines the winner based on the game's classic rules, and then outputs the result.

The game is designed to be easy to understand and fun to play, allowing players to continuously engage with the program by offering repeated rounds. Key elements of the game include:

Randomization: The computer's selection is randomized using the random.choice() function from the random module.
User Input: Players input their choice, which is then compared to the computer's randomized selection.
Game Logic: The rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors are applied to determine if the player wins, loses, or ties.
Replay Feature: The game can be replayed multiple times based on the user's preference.
